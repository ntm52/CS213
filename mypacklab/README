You must implement the following functions:
  * parse_header()
  * calculate_checksum()
  * lfsr_step()
  * decrypt_data()
  * decompress_data()
  * join_float_array()

Your implementations must go in unpack-utilities.c.
You can find documentation for how these functions should behave in unpack-utilities.h.

To compile your code, type "make" (without the quotes).

If you are curious how unpack works under the hood, you can read unpack.c.

You can write unit tests in test-utilities.c, and they will be compiled to a test-utilities program for you.
